## Scale vs. personalisation

--
.pull-left[
.hand-gray[Many (mentees) to few (mentors)]
- Great for community building among mentees
- High reach, low "cost" (in terms of mentor time)
- Personal relationships harder to establish
]
--
.pull-right[
.hand-gray[One (mentee) to one (mentor)]
- Great for building personal relationships
- Matching requires more care
- Harder to scale
]

## Closing thoughts

- Time is short? Consider **drive by mentoring**:
  - Pass opportunities to colleagues who are earlier in their careers
  - Offer mentorship for the *particular* opportunity you're passing on
  - Pay attention to the diversity profile of those you reach out to

--
- Recognize a need but unable to build a program? Plug in to **established communities**:
  - e.g., R-Ladies - [rladies.org](http://rladies.org/)
  - Direct your students/early-career (or late-career!) colleagues, volunteer your time

--
- Building a new program? Consider
  - **artefacts** mentees can "graduate" with
  - mentors **internal and external** to institution
  - **recognition** for mentor and mentee effort
